General Information
===================

  pyReScene is a port of ReScene .NET to the Python programming language.
ReScene is a mechanism for backing up and restoring the metadata from "scene" 
released RAR files. RAR archive volumes are rebuild using the stored metadata 
in the SRR file and the extracted files from the RAR archive. This process
only worked on RAR files created with "Store" mode (otherwise known as 
-m0 or No Compression), but since pyReScene version 0.4 this is also possible
for various other compression settings. However, it is not guaranteed that
reconstruction of compressed archives is always possible. pyReScene consists
of multiple related tools and scripts.

  pyReSample is a companion to ReScene. It does for samples what ReScene does 
for RARs. You can use ReSample to build a blueprint of an AVI, MKV, MP4 or WMV
sample, and then use that blueprint (the .srs file) with the full video file
to recreate that sample. It contains backups of all parts of the sample file 
that are not the actual track data as well as a signature that helps ReSample 
locate the missing track data from the full video file.

  pyReScene Auto makes it all a bit easier. One command to create an SRR file.
It does not require write access to the release directories and it can create
SRR files of your whole collection!

  pyReScene Usenet is able to create SRR files from NZB files. It works by
downloading only (parts of) the segments it needs for creating an SRR file.
srr_usenet.py and other NZB related scripts are located in the usenet 
directory. The compiled _yenc.so module (for more speed) can be obtained from 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yenc/. Create a srr_usenet.cfg configuration file 
in the usenet directory for easy usage. A template example file is available.

Dependencies
============

pyReScene requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run. There are some executables
made available for Windows users. There are currently no required
external dependencies. However, if you want to reconstruct compressed RAR
volumes, you will need to obtain a couple of the shareware (Win)RAR packages.
These files will need to be preprocessed by the bin/preprardir.py script.
This script extracts the RAR executables from the archives and renames them
for further usage. The new folder with RAR executables will need to be passed
to the -z parameter of ReScene when reconstructing compressed archives.

Installation instructions
=========================

python setup.py install

Windows installation instructions
=================================

Install Python 2.7. Download it from http://www.activestate.com/activepython
Install it to C:\Python27\ for example.

Place the source somewhere on your hard disk. e.g. C:\pyReScene\
Copy pysrr.bat and pysrs.bat to a folder that is in your PATH.
e.g. C:\Windows\System32\
Edit the .bat files to reflect the path where Python and the script source code
is located: e.g. C:\Python27\python.exe C:\pyReScene\bin\srr %*

Now you will be able to call 'pysrr' from any directory.
