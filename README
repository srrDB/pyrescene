General Information
===================

  pyReScene is a port of ReScene .NET to the Python programming language.
ReScene is a mechanism for backing up and restoring the metadata from "scene" 
released RAR files. RAR archive volumes are rebuild using the stored metadata 
in the SRR file and the extracted files from the RAR archive. This process
only worked on RAR files created with "Store" mode (otherwise known as 
-m0 or No Compression), but since pyReScene version 0.4 this is also possible
for various other compression settings. However, it is not guaranteed that
reconstruction of compressed archives is always possible. pyReScene consists
of multiple related tools and scripts.

  pyReSample is a companion to ReScene. It does for samples what ReScene does 
for RARs. You can use ReSample to build a blueprint of an AVI, MKV, MP4 or WMV
sample, and then use that blueprint (the .srs file) with the full video file
to recreate that sample. It contains backups of all parts of the sample file 
that are not the actual track data as well as a signature that helps ReSample 
locate the missing track data from the full video file.
  Also MP3 and FLAC music files are supported. The tags with all the meta data
are copied to the SRS file. This can be restored at another time. fpcalc
must be available in your path to use this feature. It can be downloaded from
https://bitbucket.org/acoustid/chromaprint/downloads. This tool creates
AcoustID music fingerprints. http://acoustid.org/chromaprint

  pyReScene Auto makes it all a bit easier. One command to create an SRR file.
It does not require write access to the release directories and it can create
SRR files of your whole collection!

  pyReScene Usenet is able to create SRR files from NZB files. It works by
downloading only (parts of) the segments it needs for creating an SRR file.
srr_usenet.py and other NZB related scripts are located in the usenet 
directory. The compiled _yenc.so module (for more speed) can be obtained from 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yenc/. Create a srr_usenet.cfg configuration file 
in the usenet directory for easy usage. A template example file is available.

Some related external tools are included into the repository:

  Awescript is a Usenet downloads post processing script made by Guber. It is
able to create SRR files and extract RAR archives.

  Rerar is a tool written in Python 3 by Vadmium to re-create sets of 
uncompressed rar files. It can also report the metadata and parameters 
stored in a rar file. It should be able to exactly re-create many real-world 
RAR files if the right input parameters and metadata are known.

Dependencies
============

 - Python (http://www.activestate.com/activepython)
 - Chromaprint* (https://acoustid.org/chromaprint)
 - UnRAR* (http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)
 - Shareware WinRAR setup files* (http://rescene.wikidot.com/rar-versions)

* Works without, but required for certain functionality.

pyReScene requires Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3 to run. There are some executables
made available for Windows users. fpcalc is necessary for creating 
music SRS files. If you want to reconstruct compressed RAR volumes, 
you will need to obtain a couple of the shareware (Win)RAR packages.
These files will need to be preprocessed by the bin/preprardir.py script.
This script extracts the RAR executables from the archives and renames them
for further usage. The new folder with RAR executables will need to be passed
to the -z parameter of ReScene when reconstructing compressed archives.
UnRAR.exe or its Linux equivalent is required for SRR creation of vobsubs.

Installation instructions
=========================

python setup.py install

Install chromaprint from your repository or put the fpcalc executable
somewhere in your path. It will also work if you put it in the ./bin or
./resample directory.

Windows installation instructions
=================================

Install Python 3.3. Download it from http://www.activestate.com/activepython
Install it to C:\Python33\ for example.

Place the source somewhere on your hard disk. e.g. C:\pyReScene\

Add the bin\windows directory to your path.
  * Run add_to_path.bat that you can find in that directory.
    It'll overwrite your USER path. (!= SYSTEM path and was empty for me)
  * Or add it manually: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm

Done! Now you will be able to call 'pyrescene' from any directory.


Another way, but better to not mess with Windows folders:
Copy the .bat to a folder that is in your PATH.
    e.g. C:\Windows\System32\ [note]
Edit the .bat files to reflect the path where Python and the script source code
is located: e.g. C:\Python33\python.exe C:\pyReScene\bin\srr %*

[note] If .exe files are placed in C:\Windows\System32\ and they fail to run,
       move them to C:\Windows\SysWOW64
       Even better would be to use your own folder you've added to the PATH!

Linux installation instructions
===============================

Make sure you can run the 32 bit rar binaries when you try to reconstruct
compressed rar archives: http://rescene.wikidot.com/faq#x64

A one stop solution to create SRR files is the following command:

    python pyrescene.py -r --best /root/directory/to/check

  This command will recursively check /root/directory/to/check for scene
  releases. Sample files are checked against the main movie files (-s) and SRR
  files for compressed RARs are also created (-c). An SRR file for vobsubs
  will be created recursively if unrar can be found (-v). --best: -c -s -v
  
To create a .srr file for vobsubs, do:

    python pyrescene.py --vobsubs file.sfv

  Pointing to the .rar file works too and 
  Windows users can use the vs.bat shortcut.
