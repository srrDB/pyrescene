pyReScene
=========

 - SRR support for RAR5 files <supportATrarlab.com>
 - SRR support for ZIP files
 - Make SFX volumes rescenable
 - *.sfv as the first parameter (srr.py. Use Linux shell?)
 - add, remove, rename stored files from CLI
 - new block for empty directories? (use empty.txt instead for dirfixes?)
 - do not create SRR based on empty SFV files (but do so when .mkv in there)
 - here's an idea: if you find a tool, for example the gui one, to make 
   the srr process automated, like select target folder > rescene scans it, 
   makes a new folder somewhere else and copies the finished srrs in a perfect 
   output structure.
   i guess they want some tool to scan whatever they have and 
   rescene-resample etc automated
   without doing anything
   meaning all..create srr, check rls for missing samples and resample, 
   reconstruct avi's from srr etc
   but not with commands etc i guess..they just want buttons and automatic
   maybe an app which scans all your drives , checks which rls dont have srr 
   on site, create srr for them, download srr packages from srrdb and re-sample
   those rls which have missing Sample
 - automatically check for rar executables in srr.exe dir
 - new parameter: it must behave like -n (faster than recreating everything), 
   except when the release new files 
   compared to the ones stored in the existing srr release folder, 
   contains new files. new in the sense of addition e.g. proof jpg
 - add a switch (like -z) for a single executable (compressed RAR reconstruction)
 - add --broken-samples parameter (used with --list-releases option)
 - SRRs for extracted disk image files or burned to disk
    
pyReSample
==========

 - Support for additional video formats
    * OGM
 - Reconstruct LOL AVI samples correctly. (visible skip)
 - try to extract/verify sample from one big AVI (sample across CDs)
   (http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/Bobby.Deerfield.1977.DVDrip.XviD-DnB)
   "Successfully rebuilt sample: dnb-bd-sample.avi" .. when before I kept 
   getting ... "Unable to extract correct amount of data for track 0. Aborting.
