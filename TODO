pyReScene
=========

 - SRR support for RAR5 files <supportATrarlab.com>
 - SRR support for ZIP files
 - *.sfv as the first parameter
 - add, remove, rename stored files from CLI
 - new block for empty directories?
 - do not create SRR based on empty SFV files (but do so when .mkv in there)
 - show SRR differences -> use rescene.php
 - "Defently pysrr still dosnt work correctly when path is too long when 
   I'm missing about 100 samples"
   It created an srr, and stored all the files in, but didnt list any rar files
 - pysrr runs slow sometimes (and not a hard disk issue)
 - here's an idea: if you find a tool, for example the gui one, to make 
   the srr process automated, like select target folder > rescene scans it, 
   makes a new folder somewhere else and copies the finished srrs in a perfect 
   output structure.
   i guess they want some tool to scan whatever they have and 
   rescene-resample etc automated
   without doing anything
   meaning all..create srr, check rls for missing samples and resample, 
   reconstruct avi's from srr etc
   but not with commands etc i guess..they just want buttons and automatic
   maybe an app which scans all your drives , checks which rls dont have srr 
   on site, create srr for them, download srr packages from srrdb and re-sample
   those rls which have missing Sample
 - Never.on.Sunday.1960.DVDRip.XviD-AEN
 - fail on empty sfv
 - automatically check for rar executables in srr.exe dir
 - new parameter: it must behave like -n (faster than recreating everything), 
   except when the release new files 
   compared to the ones stored in the existing srr release folder, 
   contains new files. new in the sense of addition e.g. proof jpg
 - add a switch (like -z) for a single executable
    
pyReSample
==========

 - Support for additional video formats
    * VOB (DVDRs)
    * M2TS (BDRs)
    * OGM
    * MPEG
 - Be able to use the srs command like this: srs *.mp4
 - try to extract sample from one big AVI (sample across CDs)
    
    
General
=======

 - Figure out how to get all the unit tests completing successfully when 
   running them all at once with nose in Eclipse instead of running them 
   individually. https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
