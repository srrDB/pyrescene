Converted to TODO and NEWS:

-o *.nfo *.jpg fails if there is no jpg in the dir
not -o, -s
	=> -s something.nfo -s *.jpg
- It would be nice if it was possible to use *sfv on the first paramete

Feature request: Be able to use the srs command like this: srs *.mp4

http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/

DONE! - list file size in verbose output	=> possible!
DONE! - repair with missing files
DONE! - create paths when extracting files (.NET never does this) -> it does with -p parameter?
DONE! - add, remove, rename stored files
DONE! - Re-creating RAR file: linuxpath.part1.rar
	Could not locate data file: /home/me/test/subdir/dir_in_rar\filelist.txt
	.net bug?
- .NET can not recreate http://www.srrdb.com/details.php?release=Psych.S06E02.HDTV.XviD-P0W4
	-> doesn't write the corrupt end block; the fix:
	
					else if (block.RawType >= (byte)RarBlockType.RarMin && block.RawType <= (byte)RarBlockType.RarMax || block.RawType == 0x00)
					{
						// -> P0W4 cleared RAR archive end block: almost all zeros except for the header length field
						// copy any other rar blocks to the destination unmodified
						rarfs.Write(block.RawData, 0, block.RawData.Length);
					}
	
- new block for empty standalone directory
- new block for oso hashes of archived files (at the end of an srr file?)
- skip new .rar, r00,... archives when the contents aren't found
DONE! but creates bad rars for other files - recreate rars of only a single cd/extras

- dot not create srr based on empty sfv files
- instead of renaming the temporary files, put their data inside the original srr file	? -> but is more IO!
DONE! ? separate script - fix merged srr files/detect
- show srr differences
- indicate when something smells in an srr file
- calculate filecount (# of rars for the main movie)
- calculate total size of the release based on an srr file
- list rars in cli that should not be tried to repair
	
- same exit codes as .net version
- resample: try to extract sample from one big avi (sample across cds)
	"Successfully rebuilt sample: dnb-bd-sample.avi" .. when before I kept getting ... "Unable to extract correct amount of data for track 0. Aborting.

- http://fire.no-ip.info/FireSCene/details.php?release=Brave.Story.2006.DVD5.720p.BluRay.x264-FaNSuB
  sample does not work with getid3()
DONE! - Python 2.6+ support
- .exe support Windows
http://guide.python-distribute.org/

- hachoir find out values of missing stuff
- CRC support: in srr file; make it possible to check rars for correctness
while creating srr?
	- function to pass through all streams and calculates CRC in between
- possibility to check .sfv/.rars (build-in crcs -> done while constructing!) afterwards


- much smaller (even then rar) for srr files:
http://tukaani.org/xz/format.html
http://blog.endpoint.com/2009/11/xz-compression.html
Best RAR compression compressed better than 7z, bzip2 and gzip, but XZ
resulted in the smallest file sizes although not much different than RAR.
XZ uses the LZMA2 compression algorithm and is supported by 7-zip.
  -> do a larger test

Up to 2.5, Python was still compatible with Windows 95, 98 and ME (but already 
raised a deprecation warning on installation). For Python 2.6 (and all 
following releases), this support was dropped and new releases are just 
expected to work on the Windows NT family.

<superwad> always!
<superwad> no, the db isn't updated
<StasuMygd> no that wasnt the question
<StasuMygd> :D
<superwad> what's up?
<StasuMygd> is there any way to edit an existing .srr?
<superwad> in what way?
<StasuMygd> removing archived files
<StasuMygd> let me show you what i mean with an example
<StasuMygd> rocky.2.dvdrip.german.ac3-cultxvid.ac3
<StasuMygd> rocky.2.dvdrip.french.ac3-cultxvid.ac3
<StasuMygd> rocky.2.dvdrip.italian.ac3-cultxvid.ac3
<StasuMygd> rocky.2.dvdrip.spanish.ac3-cultxvid.ac3
<StasuMygd> http://xvid.rescene.info/details.aspx?Section=Movies&Release=Rocky.II.1979.iNTERNAL.DVDRip.XviD-CULTXviD
<StasuMygd> those 4 archived files in that srr i dont have and i dont want them anyway
<StasuMygd> but the rebuild wont happen exactly because i dont have those files which are actually movie extras
<superwad> quite right
<superwad> unfortunately, i don't think it's possible to remove stored files that way
<superwad> you can only extract stored files, but not change the rar signatures stored
<superwad> the rar signatures of course determine what avi files are "stored" in the srr
<superwad> the only option would be to get those files and reconstruct, then remake the srr
<superwad> i don't think it's entirely in the spirit of srr to put extras in with the main movie
<superwad> unless they were packed in the same dir, like multi-cd releases
<StasuMygd> getting the files is an issue
<StasuMygd> cant seem to find them
<StasuMygd> silly point of interest: i have actually found the rls rared and all somewhere else :P
<StasuMygd> w/o the files in question
<StasuMygd> but since i had it unrared
<StasuMygd> thought it would be an interesting challenge
<StasuMygd> to see if it could be rebuild
<StasuMygd> w/o the missing files :D
<superwad> i wonder
<superwad> do srr without any parameters
<superwad> to see what options you have
<superwad> check if there are any options to rebuild with missing files
<superwad> if not, umlaut might have a new feature request :)
<StasuMygd> nay.. dont see any way to rebuild with missing files
<superwad> darn
<StasuMygd> which means smth like an option to choose which of the archived files to rebuild would be cool to add

<Gfy> Isn't it possible by creating files with the exact bytesize and name? The main movie files will succed and you can delete the extra rars afterwards.
<Gfy> and you probably have to use this parameter:
<Gfy>  -u: Disable automatic CRC checking during reconstruction.
<YopoM> hmmmmmm
<YopoM> that's a thought
<YopoM> can always try it; I know my script DOES add rars in an /extra folder to the srr, if it exists
<YopoM> since it's a part of the release
<YopoM> I also add the "Sfv only" in and subs dir (but not the rar itself, as per discussions here)
<YopoM> *in any
<YopoM> eww, that Rocky.II.1979.iNTERNAL.DVDRip.XviD-CULTXviD .. was messy, as released, should have put those avi's into a sep folder
<YopoM> (i.e., /extras)
* defier is nu bekend als defier`
<YopoM> ah, I see, the additional avi's are in rars named rocky.2.dvdrip.ac3-cultxvid.rxx (13F)
* Axims heeft verlaten (ZNC - http://znc.sourceforge.net)
<YopoM> trying to dup this siutation with another test set, the web lists the file sizes of the archived files, but seems srr won't, even with the -l -v switches
<YopoM> in fact, on list (-l), the -v does nothing at all
<YopoM> since the web does show the file size needed to 'fake', we have that param, but if it was an srr NOT from the web db, then no way to know what the size is needed to be 'to fake'
* |CF| (10384blub@hate-me.or.love-me.la) heeft #x264.rescene.info verlaten
<YopoM> ironically, if those avi's were listed last in the srr, it would work with nothing more needed
<YopoM> ah, on size, let it err out, and then size expected is displayed, then correct to right size
<YopoM> Gfy .. you were abs corrrect, and -u isn't even needed
<YopoM> set up a same test, using diff avi's, then created as junk avi to use as input for re-create, and here's the results
<YopoM> Re-creating stored file: zzz.sfv
<YopoM> Re-creating stored file: timmy.steals.the.show.2011.dvdrip.xvid-sprinter.sfv

kiczek	HellRezor sometimes a sample doesnt recreate with an SRS in those cases I just include the whole sample in the SRR
14:20	kiczek	which is what you have to do when encoders include 2 samples for a PROPER for instance
14:21	kiczek	obviously you cannot recreate a sample from a different source

20:32	BarryShit	Anyone got build instructions for rescene?
20:42	rocket_	build as in compile?
20:44	BarryShit	yeah, I want to make an ubuntu package, so I need to compile from source
20:45	rocket_	ic, that's beyond me eheh, poke umlaut
20:46	BarryShit	I just need the command line command to compile it
	BarryShit	umlaut: can you help?
	rocket_	it's not that straightforward afaik
20:47	rocket_	umlaut is not around most of the time, just hang in here and someone more linux savvy than me will get to you eventualy
20:48	BarryShit	the csc command in windows would help
20:49	rocket_	can you run it from within wine or something?
	rocket_	*can't
	BarryShit	I can run the distributed binary using mono
20:50	BarryShit	but you can't submit a package to ubuntu or debian without having it automatically build form the source package on their machines
	rocket_	ah, right
20:54	AWingsFan	it should (in theory) be the same steps as compiling it from source as .NET things on Windows just with mono.
20:55	BarryShit	AWingsFan: I'm not a C# dev so instructions would be nice
	AWingsFan	I don't really know why you'd need to submit it to ubuntu or debian anyways since you install mono, put the exes in the right place and go.
	AWingsFan	BarryShit: I'm not either 
	BarryShit	it's so it is available for others using debian and ubuntu
20:56	BarryShit	they can go apt-get rescene and it will install on their machines
	AWingsFan	well, I guess that's all fine and good but I'd hope that by the time you have it submitted, umlaut will have REFRESHED THE GODDAMN DATABASE
	AWingsFan	because he's pretty far behind on that (August/September was the last refresh, right?)
	Gfy	It's done for Arch Linux, but they just to use the .exe: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=44749
20:57	AWingsFan	oh hey, I know that dryes name...
20:58	BarryShit		Gfy: on debian they wouldn't accept the package if the source wasn't readily available in the repo

20:59	Gfy	Have you tried opening the sources in Mono Develop and then pressing the compile button?
21:00	BarryShit	Wouldn't I need the sln file it's not supplied with the source
21:01	Gfy	just create a new project en copy the files into it
	Gfy	and maybe move if you get errors
21:06	BarryShit	I get "Unsafe code requires the `unsafe' command line option to be specified"
21:08	Gfy	no idea, but I would check the project properties or something
	Gfy	maybe you can check unsafe somewhere
	BarryShit	I think I need to set up specific options in MD to build it, if anyone has a vstudio sln file that would help
21:09	BarryShit	There is a field in md for addition arguments I'll do some googling
21:11	Gfy	-unsafe or /unsafe probably
	BarryShit	Yeah already got there
	BarryShit	that worked new problem
21:13	BarryShit	The type or namespace name 'RegularExpressions' does not exist in `System.Text'. Are you missing an assembly reference?
21:15	Gfy	Google quote: "You have referenced System.Text.RegularExpressions in your code, but you
	Gfy	apparently never added Regular Expressions to your list of project
	Gfy	references.
	Gfy	Go into the project explorer and add a reference to the library."

17:57 < furtim> does anyone know if theres some kind of flag to do a
                test/verify of the srr without actually rebuilding the rars?
17:59 -!- defier` [~x@217.18.70.193] has quit [ZNC -
          http://znc.sourceforge.net]
18:15 -!- defier` [~x@217.18.70.193] has joined #x264.rescene.info
18:52 < HellRezor> the srr has the checksum for the extracted content, you
                   could compare that to the file you have
18:53 < HellRezor> but i don't belive you can normally view that info
                   although it is available on the db page
18:57 < lrkj> open the srr file in winrar to see the crc32 value of the files
18:57 < lrkj> create an sfv file for your extracted content and verify
              manually


03:39 < gomtuu> Oh, from when I asked it last night?
03:39 < AWingsFan> [15:35:35] <lrkj> mv filelist.txt dir_in_rar\\fileliest.txt
03:39 < AWingsFan> apparently (I joined after you left)
03:40 < gomtuu> IC
03:40 < gomtuu> Thanks for letting me know. :)
03:42 < gomtuu> Well, I'll have to go to bed in a few hours, but for anyone who might read this:
03:44 < gomtuu> I've since been able to get srr.exe to reconstruct my RARs, but they're damaged (most of them are missing between 1 and 5 par2 blocks)
03:45 < gomtuu> The way I got it sort-of working was be recompiling srr.cs with the SearchOption.AllDirectories flag added to the GetFiles call in the
                autoLocateRenamed routine, but for some reason, srr.exe complains about CRC errors while it's rebuilding, and, like I said, the RARs are
                damaged.
03:48 < gomtuu> (Also, that's not an ideal solution if it recursively searches the whole inputdir tree. That could be really slow.)
03:51 < gomtuu> Before I tried the SearchOption approach, I tried setting srcName = srcName.Replace('\\', Path.DirectorySeparatorChar) around line 490. That
                seemed to perform the correct substitution, but srr.exe still couldn't find the first file in my archive, probably because it contains an
                umlaut o. The error message did change from:
03:53 -!- diskdocx [~diskdoc1@d24-141-141-139.home.cgocable.net] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
03:53 < gomtuu> Could not locate data file: /home/me/test/subdir/dir_in_rar\filelist.txt to /home/me/test/subdir/dir_in_rar/filelist.txt, but in my case the
                "filelist.txt" file has an umlaut o in it.
03:59 < gomtuu> I looked at the RAR file and the SRR file, and the umlaut o is encoded as a single byte (0x94) in both files, so I guess that's CP437. I don't
                know how to tell what it's encoded as in the filesystem, but my locale is set to UTF-8, so that's probably it.
03:59 < gomtuu> Also, if I use xxd (a hex viewer) to inspect srr.exe's "Could not locate data file" output, there's "EF BF BD" where the umlaut o should be. I
                have no idea why it would be that. If it were UTF-8, it'd be "C3 B6"...
03:59 < gomtuu> So, hopefully that helps.
04:02 < gomtuu> I'll stay in the channel this time in case someone wants to reply.


YopoM	awescript isn't that difficult,many have run it on their collections
	YopoM	I remember ryback was here
	YopoM	he contributed quite a few

13:34 < HellRezor> if only it was as simple as comparing file names
13:40 < HellRezor> but before you can declare an srr a dupe you need to make sure its actually for the same rars (one could be a repack) that it doesn't
                   contain missing parts (srs/nfo/sfv/jpg) that it doesn't contain a different version of included files (srs/nfo/sfv/jpg) that might be more
                   correct while taking into account that nfo/sfv files could be the same but with different endline character
13:40 < HellRezor> (unix/mac/dos) style, that the srs might be better (i.e. created with the -c switch opposed to without) that the srr might be created with
                   the -p switch as opposed to without .... and possibly more i can think about right now
13:41 < HellRezor> *can't
13:43 < HellRezor> oh and sfv files that had junk added to them by bad sfv checkers or that had been created on a date different then the release (could
                   indicate a repack)
                  
                  
HellRezor	first thing is to ignore the newline type for the nfo/sfv since it makes no difference
	HellRezor	as far as you should be concenred when thats the only diff the files are identical
20:04	HellRezor	now for the sfv, you should compare a normalized version no comments sorted by filename and and in lowercase , just to make sure you're dealing with the same files after that a visual inspection might be required to see if one was recreated later on
	HellRezor	yeah those shows don't use the normal season/ep format
                  
HellRezor	the first thing to check before comparing sfv/nfo to see if one srr contain new data for the same release is check that the srr itself is for the same rar files (name/crc32) and content (name/crc32)
20:09	HellRezor	after that you check if the new one contain an srs , and if the old one contains one too you check if they are for the same sample (name/crc32) and if the new one is better (i.e. created with the -c switch while the old one wasn't)
20:10	Skalman^	Ok, but crc32 will most likely noty match since most is made with older software and not the lastest 1.2
	HellRezor	its crc32 the algorithem and its results are ancient
20:11	Gfy	Jay.Leno.2009.09.14.Jerry.Seinfeld.720p.HDTV.x264-MOMENTUM ever other date formats used than this one?
	HellRezor	it would match for the same content
20:12	Skalman^	oh the srs fileformat stores the crc for the sample file, i think you meant the crc32 for the actual srs file
	HellRezor	no for the actuall sample, to see if they were bother for the same one
20:13	HellRezor	the srs crc32 value would ofcourse change with version/switches etc
	HellRezor	but the one inside for the sample should be the same
20:14	HellRezor	all other things being equal an srr with sorted content (created with the -p switch , cd1 rars in CD1 srs in Sample etc..) should be considered better
20:17	Skalman^	Hmm, I think its gonna be too much to code :/
	Skalman^	checking if the -c switch was used and all :/
20:18	HellRezor	the last thing you check is the sfv where you can ignore those you know for sure are the same (only difference is newline char or uppercase/lowercase crc32 values or both) and visual inspection to determine other cases if the normalized version is the same (striped of comments sorted and lowercased) because if its not something is wrong
	HellRezor	shouldn't be too hard the indication is right there in the srs file
20:19	HellRezor	anyhow all these checks and conditions are the kind that you get right once, and make life easier from then on
20:21		-> WormDr1nk is x264.rescene.info binnengekomen
20:23	Skalman^	Ok. I'll think about it for sure
20:24	HellRezor	heh  you'll probably think about it everytime you need to decide if its a dupe or not
20:25	HellRezor	just think of all the cases you'll get 'yes its a dupe, safe to delete' or 'its the same release but new one is better' leaving you to only deal with those that require a human eye

03:43 <Skalman^> you could add so it detects if two srrs have been merged
03:44 <Skalman^> Its a valid srr and works with srr.exe, but its an ugly method
03:45 <lrkj> what do you mean with merged?
03:45 <Skalman^> copy srr1.srr + srr2.srr srr3.srr
03:45 <Skalman^> like that
03:45 <Skalman^> two files into one
03:45 <Skalman^> srr1 and srr2 would become a new file srr3
03:45 <lrkj> ah, didn't think of that one yet

10:16 < schnappy> Interesting issue - a sample can't be read by WMP (coreavc), but can be read my VLC. srs can't read it... hmmm
10:17 < schnappy> "File size does not appear to be correct!" "Expected: 52" "Found : 41,943,040" "COrruption detected: Invalid element length at 0x0270e21d.

10:20 < schnappy> Skalman^, any chance you could add an option to upload just SRS files? I know it's wierd but i have samples but not oRAR's of some things...
10:21 < schnappy> and nfo's
10:33 < YopoM> VLC can read broken files; but they still are broken, and srs catches all errors
10:36 < schnappy> but it's still the sample of the release ;)
10:37 < YopoM> a broken sample
10:37 < schnappy> which some players can duct tape together
10:37 < schnappy> im just throwing it out there that srs doesnt work all the time ;)

11:13 < YopoM> ah, I'll have to grab the samples and make srs myself; I was actually rebuilding them from the srs you supplied; Fails (not your fault)
11:13 < YopoM> They are made with ... [ISFT]IMEncoder 1.0rc2-4.2.1 ... and that's one of the issue with srs, won't work with that vs of mencoder
11:14 < YopoM> Does work with mencoder-Sherpya-SVN-r32198-4.2.5
11:29 < YopoM> Anyone expecting to use the current vers of srs to create samples for this writing app, can't. It will take a new version of srs to do so.
11:31 < YopoM> I'll paste what happens here ... some lines pasting now

11:32 < YopoM> Rebuild failed for sample: tour.de.france.2011.stage18.highlights.ws.pdtv.xvid-w4f-sample.avi
11:32 < YopoM> but, this is a long known issue; nothing else can be done as it is
11:34 < YopoM> (That MEmcoder interleaves the avi records .. all other other writing apps make the avi records sequential, and he expects that to happen, or
               something along those lines)
11:36 < YopoM> so, actual sample is 1,3,2,4,6,5
11:36 < YopoM> and srs rewrites it 1,2,3,4,5,6
11:36 < schnappy> i see
11:37 < schnappy> but didnt you say you were going to redo it? so... wont you have the same issue?
11:37 < YopoM> and when you play the rebuilt sample, it's .. lmao .. fugly!!!!!!!!!
11:38 < YopoM> I said, I was going to use your supplied srs to make the sample from the rars; and I could not, so I had to dl the samples and rebuild all
11:38 < schnappy> right ok then
11:38 < YopoM> anyway, they're in the db
11:39 < schnappy> when you make the srs
11:39 < schnappy> wont it be the same srs?
11:39 < YopoM> yup
11:50 < YopoM> all right, all finished, going to leave one unconfirmed, although it is done and rdy to be (a place marker)

12:22 < XDot> anyone uses everything program?
12:31 < HellRezor> what program ?
12:34 < XDot> everything
12:35 < XDot> http://forum.voidtools.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=592
12:35 < XDot> http://www.voidtools.com/Everything-1.2.1.451a.zip
12:35 < XDot> its a search program
12:35 < XDot> for your files
12:35 < XDot> instant search
12:36 < XDot> its great
12:36 < XDot> only that i want to list all folders which dont have /Sample
12:36 < XDot> but i dont know how
12:49 < HellRezor> for /d %d in (*-*) do IF NOT EXIST %d\Sample ( echo %d >> sampleless.txt )
12:49 < HellRezor> try this ^
14:30 < Skalman^> this site has really good documentation on that: http://ss64.com/nt/for.html

15:16 < HellRezor> srs can't be created for a vob
15:17 < HellRezor> theoretically it might be with some alterations but even so you'd need the dvd or a dvdr release so its not practical
15:27 < HellRezor> mmm well comparing srs files isn't usefull, you need to see whats on the inside if its the same size/name/crc32 then its the same srs
15:28 < HellRezor> then the only thing that should matter is if one was created with the -c switch than its the better one

15:51 < Skalman^> If I have an srr with CD1 and CD2, and only the avi for CD1, can I still recreate it=
15:51 < Skalman^> and skip CD2?
15:51 < HellRezor> not sure, umlaut said he'll something about it at some point but i can't recall if it happened
15:52 < Skalman^> Ok
15:52 < Skalman^> becuase I really hate that a couple of releases has two srrs and I would like to put them in one:
                  http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/browse.php?q=-extras
15:53 < HellRezor> give it the good ol' trial and error ?
15:53 < Skalman^> but I can't do that if its not possible to recreate CD1 and CD2 without the extras, that would be stupid
15:53 < Skalman^> hmm yea I'm gonna try that
15:53 < HellRezor> what extras do you mean ?
15:54 < Skalman^> http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/browse.php?q=Animalympics
15:54 < Skalman^> Is that 2 pre?
15:54 < HellRezor> and you're sure that those were released together ?
15:55 < HellRezor> the whole -extras thing makes it suspicious
15:55 < HellRezor> better see if anything is mentioned in nfo
15:55 < HellRezor> + Extra SizeÂ·Â·[ 175MB / 13x15MB
15:56 < Skalman^> I think so yes, because if you look, none of them have nfo or srs: http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/browse.php?q=-extras thats a bit
                  suspisios :P
15:57 < HellRezor> this one is Star.Trek.DS9.S01-EXTRAs.DVDRip.Divx.FFM very suspicious

Skalman^	error?
17:07	Skalman^	what error lol
	HellRezor	and how do you get nuked from an error
	XDot	 <XDot> unable to extract correct amount of data for track 0.aborting
17:08	Skalman^	and you tried on cd2 too?
17:09	XDot	yes
	XDot	hm
	XDot	http://fire.no-ip.info/FireSCene/details.php?release=Dont.Look.Now.1973.iNTERNAL.Dual.Audio.DVDRip.XviD-RiTALiX
	Skalman^	ok, then the samples is probably encoded seperatley or something, I dont know exactly how this works
	XDot	same for this
	XDot	it says track 1 though
	XDot	unable to locate track signature for track 1
	
00:07 < Skalman^> a dirfix/nfofix etc are always pred with just an nfo?
00:08 < YopoM> dirfix needs nothing

Skalman^	Yea, comes with an nfo (if not it would be nuked as missing nfo? :D)
	HellRezor	not neccesarily sometimes its just a folder
17:37	HellRezor	storing the fix inside the release its relevant to, solves the problem of not being able to create an srr for just an nfo and keeping relevant information where its needed

19:53 < YopoM> Here is a 9 line batch file that you run at the root of your TVseries folder
19:53 < YopoM> @echo off
19:53 < YopoM> if %1~==NEXT2~ goto PASS2
19:53 < YopoM> FOR /D %%T in (*.*) do call %0 NEXT2 %%T
19:53 < YopoM> goto alldone
19:53 < YopoM> :PASS2
19:53 < YopoM> pushd %2
19:53 < YopoM> for /d %%d in (*-*) do IF NOT EXIST %%d\Sample ( echo %%d >> ..\sampleless.txt )
19:53 < YopoM> popd
19:53 < YopoM> :alldone
19:54 < YopoM> it's works only for a 3 level structure
20:11 < YopoM> an improvement might be to also list the part series path, so tat one line would change to this ....
20:11 < YopoM> for /d %%d in (*-*) do IF NOT EXIST %%d\Sample ( echo %2\%%d >> ..\sampleless.txt )


YopoM	the one drawback to slapping multi cd into one srr; which as you and umlaut know .. I did not .. for thousands ... then I was convinced with sound arguments .. and conact all my multi cd srr into 1 (copy /b cd1+cd2 cdALL)

                   
08:00	HellRezor	well i'll need to rework things so the .sfv is still included in the copy without subs, right now i have one with subs and one without
08:13	HellRezor	http://pastebin.com/bWMyXgSM srr_srs_folder.bat
HellRezor	this one stores the subs sfv in both copies
08:14	HellRezor	just make the line with 'pause' on it a blank one for the "_np" version



YopoM	XDot .. here is a batch file you can run, and no matter how far down the files are it will work
	YopoM	http://pastebin.com/6Yj4FpqC
19:41	XDot	huge thx
	XDot	it would be nicer though the logfile to just list the rls names
	XDot	and not tell the paths
19:42	XDot	so i can copy paste in that list search of Skalman^ site

23:25	YopoM	wow, that the same bit in each byte, isn't it
	YopoM	bit3
23:27	YopoM	it's some metadata issue; the rebuilt sample is perfect, just not perfectly identical to the source

03:11	YopoM	I'll be damned, this is a new one on me
03:12	YopoM	Just now was able to get this ... "Successfully rebuilt sample: dnb-bd-sample.avi" .. when before I kept getting ... "Unable to extract correct amount of data for track 0. Aborting.
03:14	YopoM	I figured what the problem was, and sure enough. They made the avi, destined to be split in 2, then made the sample, but the sample splits across the 2 avi's (perfectly legit, just have never seen it); Had to extract, then mux the 2 avi's into one, then run srs, and then it worked

YopoM	back to one earlier, I have a perfectly good avi sample here, according to ALL my tools I use, except srs.exe says it has a bad 4cc value
18:10	YopoM	which is why there was no srs for Wizards.of.Waverly.Place.The.Movie.2009.DVDRip.XviD-GFW
	YopoM	tried srs 1.2 and 0.9 beta, they all think it is bad
18:11	YopoM	-Corruption detected: Invalid FourCC value ( ) at 0x005aa066. Aborting.
gfw-wowptm.sample.avi


HellRezor	depends on the order of the files in the rar when the rar contains more then one file
18:13	HellRezor	often with extras release you need to extract and try different files when creating the srs if you wish to use the -c switch, and either way you'll need to do it when recreating the sample

YopoM	Hmm, I think I'll use that NO sample bat file myself, found a TV eps w/ no samp and had it marked as with
	YopoM	I would like to mod it to show no sample folder / and sample folder and no sample
	YopoM	*I would like to mod it to show no sample folder / and sample folder with no sample
01:32	YopoM	oh, there a lot simpsons w/o, lol
	YopoM	ah, all PDTV etc, don't care there
01:33	Joda	who the f needs a sample, if its bad its nuked
01:35	YopoM	samples are a part of the release
	YopoM	same as the subs

02:21	Skalman^	Not that mencoder too
02:23	Skalman^	oh the srs is actually wrong, because it worked when i dl the sample and create one with -c
	Skalman^	but its 2BA then... and this one says it should be ACF...
02:28	YopoM	or is it?
02:31	Skalman^	maybe I took the iniativie too quick there lol
02:34	YopoM	it seems it is
02:35	Skalman^	What do you mean?
	YopoM	the one I have here .... Sample CRC : ACF2D373 .. the one from the db ... 2BA4C919
02:36	YopoM	that's just srs -l
	YopoM	but they are diff
	YopoM	let me replace with mine, and you can dl it and try again, hang
02:37	Skalman^	hehe actually I just switched it to 2BA (thats what i meant i might be too quick there)
	YopoM	ok, try the one from the DB .. now
	Skalman^	ok
02:38	Skalman^	Expected : 7 933 952 ACF2D373

	YopoM	on another note, I think I have detected a real potential problem with srs.exe (for me) .. does anyone here run a cmd line batch file running srs.exe using the -c switch?
02:39	Skalman^	I was gonna ask the same, I think I should fix my batchfile to use the -c switch.
	YopoM	ok, the srs is the same thing, seems it is saying .. you have a bad rar set, does it pass sfv?
02:40	Skalman^	hmm
	YopoM	if a bit is different @ sample point, it would display it like that
	Skalman^	yea its fine
	Skalman^	sfv fine
	YopoM	ok, let me pull my own copy from dvd
	YopoM	and try
02:42		<- dryes is niet meer verbonden (Lost terminal)
02:43	Skalman^	yea ok thanks
02:57	YopoM	getting lost in details, so let me type a few lines for reference
	YopoM	The srs I have says ... "Sample CRC : ACF2D373"
	YopoM	the sfv line 1 .. is "line-unstop.r00 94d8dd62"
02:59	YopoM	The srs that was in the DB says ... "Sample CRC : 2BA4C919"
	Skalman^	It used to be ACF2D373 in the DB but i changed it because I was very quickly to determine it was wrong... http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/viewlog.php
03:00	Skalman^	The srs I have says "2BA4C919" and the first line on SFV is "line-unstop.r00 94d8dd62"
	Skalman^	Just something... are you using srs 1.2?
03:01	YopoM	yes
		<- wiese1 is niet meer verbonden (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
03:02	Skalman^	hmm
	Skalman^	did you create it using -c?
	YopoM	I don't use -c at all, so no
	Skalman^	Can you try that?
03:03	YopoM	does my .r00 file's sfv match yours?
	Skalman^	hehe yea ^ I typed my crc too 
	Skalman^	its the same
03:06	YopoM	I am smelling some kinda bug
03:07	Skalman^	Does it work for you too?`
	YopoM	I rebuilt a new srs on the sample, using -c
	YopoM	Sample CRC : ACF2D373
03:08	YopoM	when you try and remake from the rar, it fails
	YopoM	the one I just made fails to remake
03:09	YopoM	ok, yup
	YopoM	Expected : 7,933,952 ACF2D373
	YopoM	Actual : 7,933,952 2BA4C919
03:10	YopoM	made srs on sample with -c, ok, copy srs to parent, cd from sample to parent, srs file.srs, gives the above
03:11	Skalman^	Expected : 7 933 952 2BA4C919
	Skalman^	Actual : 7 933 952 2BA4C919
	YopoM	i.e., the one I just made that passes the -c test (data found) when rebuilt is crc error
03:12	Skalman^	made srs on sample with -c OK, copy to parent, recreate with srs srsfile.srs rarfile.rar
	YopoM	in fact, that's exactly like the one I talked about yesterday that I sent to Gfy
03:13	YopoM	except this has a whole lof of differences, not just 4
03:15	YopoM	same thing with srs 1.1
03:16	Skalman^	Okay lool. Can we say which one is the right CRC?
	YopoM	passes Gspot as well, even tho there are these binary differences
	YopoM	(it's not a corrupt avi sample)
03:17	YopoM	somehow, it cannot rebuild the metadata
03:18	Skalman^	hmm ok
03:19	YopoM	so did you also try making a new srs with -c, then try rebuilding it from that same srs?
03:21	YopoM	all of the Simpsons S01 xvid samples are also kicking out when -c used
	YopoM	they look flaky, tho
	Skalman^	yea thats when i get:
	Skalman^	Expected : 7 933 952 2BA4C919
	Skalman^	Actual : 7 933 952 2BA4C919
	YopoM	so it works for you, but not for me
03:22	YopoM	hmmmm
	YopoM	DCC me your whole sfv
	YopoM	something is really really odd
	Skalman^	Haha
	YopoM	and send me you srs as well
03:23	YopoM	simons sample name ... "The.Simpsons.S01E01.internal.dvdrip.xvid.sample-tns.avi"
	YopoM	that lookd odd
	YopoM	looks even
03:26	Skalman^	hmm but the Simpsons TNS releases arent in the db
	Skalman^	Only HOSTILE
	YopoM	yeah, I know, I was trying mine, which is TNS
03:29	YopoM	aight, i think I see what's happening
03:30	YopoM	we are relying a lot on the -c to be perfect; it may not be
03:31	YopoM	I have a sample, make srs, that cannot rebuild, but it does make a avi .. use yours to create a sample, it does, noproblem, compare that sample to the failed one, and it is the same
03:34	YopoM	even tho when I created, I used -c, and it saud that all data can be found
	YopoM	*it said
	YopoM	dir
	YopoM	oops
	YopoM	now I know I am tired, lol
03:37	Skalman^	okay but
	Skalman^	Which one is the right then?
03:39	YopoM	the one that is in the Db now (yours)
	Skalman^	Ok 
03:40	YopoM	I just put it there
	YopoM	and redl, just to make sure
	Skalman^	hehe okay thanks
	Skalman^	that was wierd
03:41	YopoM	Ok, back to -c in a batch file
03:43	YopoM	I see the date on this sample file I have is .... line-unstop-sample.avi 2004/07/10
03:44	YopoM	PRED is 2004/09/27
	YopoM	long after the date on the sample, lol
03:46	Skalman^	before?
03:47	Skalman^	your date is before it was pred?
03:58	Skalman^	hehe this one is a funny documentary about people and video games from 80s The.King.of.Kong.PROPER.RERiP.LIMITED.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD-eXtaCY
	Skalman^	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/
04:08	YopoM	I have a sample, whereby it fails the -c check; If that is in a batch file, it stops the batch file dead, no other lines are processed
04:09	YopoM	i.e., for any one that fails the -c check, it does this, for instance, here's a 2 line batch file, it will never even exceute the 2nd line
	YopoM	srs The.Simpsons.S01E01.internal.dvdrip.xvid.sample-tns.avi -c ..\simpsons-s01e01-xvid-schizo.rar
	YopoM	ECHO Am I here ??????
	Skalman^	cant you send that batchfile to me? sound really usable
	Skalman^	lol
	Skalman^	TNS sample SCHIZO release lol
04:10	YopoM	yeah, but, anything it does that
	Skalman^	oh okay
	YopoM	-c stop a batch file exceution, how in the hell can that be, lol
	YopoM	*a -c FAILURE stops ....
	YopoM	if it doesn't fail, np
04:11	YopoM	yeah, so I had been thinking of a recursive batch file that would just do the test (no actual srs creation), and report all fails into a log file
04:12	YopoM	1st fail, it's stopped dead, as I have found out
	YopoM	gotta be some weird .NET side effect is my olny guess
04:13	YopoM	on another note, yeah, do I have the wronf samples in there, lol
	YopoM	*why
04:19	YopoM	ah, because it was posted like that in usenet, and once again I just grabbed it all and dl, didn't check so well, lol
04:20	Skalman^	the one uploaded "The Daily Show" you're using a very old software beta 11 lol
04:44		<- messi10 is niet meer verbonden (—I-n-v-i-s-i-o-n— 3.2 (July '10))
05:50	HellRezor	try using 'call' YopoM
05:51	HellRezor	i remember having to tweak things for my batch file
05:52	HellRezor	anyhow yeah, -c isn't perfect, which is why umlaut said he'll add another that checks the whole tracks rather then the signiture. but -c is better than not checking at all
06:33	YopoM	yeah, after I had typed that I realized, duhhhhh, that I made srs a pathed batch file, so I could change the location at whim
	YopoM	lol
	YopoM	srs The.Simpsons.S01E01.internal.dvdrip.xvid.sample-tns.avi -c ..\simpsons-s01e01-xvid-schizo.rar
06:34	YopoM	so, no call, branches to that, and ends there
	YopoM	sometimes looking at the big picture too much, lol
06:35	YopoM	working on a batch file now to test -c all media in the path, based on that one yesterday that walks the path looking for a Sample folder

09:09	Skalman^	Another one YopoM
	Skalman^	Expected : 6 494 208 6A656586
	Skalman^	Actual : 6 494 208 63D5841B
	Skalman^	Rebuild failed for sample: bdz-linew.dvdrip.xvid.sample.avi
	Skalman^	http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/details.php?release=Linewatch.STV.DVDRip.XviD-BULLDOZER
09:11	Skalman^	Also same thing here, finding another sample somewhere that matches 6A656586
09:13	YopoM	on this one, I did not get an error
	YopoM	Check Complete. All tracks located.
	YopoM	6,494,208 6A656586
09:14	Skalman^	hmm, I try rebuild i
09:15	YopoM	What I did was srs avi -c rar
09:16	Skalman^	hmm
	Skalman^	when im using the srs from the site i get that error
09:17	YopoM	however, when I try to rebuild the one I just made that checked with -c
	YopoM	I get
	YopoM	Expected : 6,494,208 6A656586
	YopoM	Actual : 6,494,208 63D5841B
	YopoM	which is also what you got
09:19	Skalman^	oh its just something wrong with rebuilding the sample?
09:21	Skalman^	or what should it be? lol
09:22	YopoM	you know, umlaut is going to have to look at this, because an srs creates fine with -c specified, but to try and rebuild it fails
	YopoM	so I don't know why
		-> futurj1sm is x264.rescene.info binnengekomen
09:23	Skalman^	
		<- futur1sm is niet meer verbonden (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
09:26	YopoM	I dl another one, and it also 6A65.... crc32
09:28		<- futurj1sm is niet meer verbonden (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
09:29	YopoM	so maybe another test in this batch file (for a later time) is to also try and rebuild the whole sample to see if that is pass/fail
09:30	YopoM	I've already got it working for a non-multi CD with one sample only, has to put in logic for multi cd (XVID) and/or multi-sample
09:32	YopoM	when you are doing it by hand, it's easy to pair which sample should be tested via -c against the release; in automation, they all have to be, because it cannot be known
	YopoM	then again, multi-sample is prob 1 in 50 or less, so for now, just kicks out (multi sample, ignoring)
09:33		-> futur1sm is x264.rescene.info binnengekomen
	YopoM	need to see if srs fails when input is, say .part02.rar
09:34	YopoM	it fails if input is .r00
	YopoM	prob same with part02.rar
09:36	YopoM	yup
09:39	YopoM	easy enough, I've done this in other scripts (par2 creation) ... if exist *.part01.rar" .... set input to *.part01.rar .. esle set to *.rar
	YopoM	along those lines
09:44	YopoM	I see how it's going to play out ... For all Samples .. For ALL cd's (one loop if none) ... build srs, trap if error, then build srs -c and check against rar ... set flag if no error .. end ... end ... see if ANY matched, if not, error nothing matched
09:45	YopoM	this will also find bad samples (truncated, bad fourcc value, or anything)
	YopoM	I've got several, that are mb in size, yet all zeroes
	YopoM	
09:46	Skalman^	but wait... cant you just use *.rar? that will get the first rar in part01.rar and the .rar using rxx system?
	YopoM	and those simpsons s01 are abi, yet are ogg (and lately, I've seen a few vob samples named with a .avi extension)
	YopoM	*avi
09:51	YopoM	would there ever be a scenario, whereby an x264 would be in the .part001 format (versus .part01) ?
10:03		<- apokalyps is niet meer verbonden (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
10:13		-> apokalyps is x264.rescene.info binnengekomen
10:20	Skalman^	oh lol
	Skalman^	and when r99 is reached it goes over to s01 i think 
10:21	YopoM	oh, I know
	Skalman^	but I doubt that would happen lol
10:22	YopoM	bu would they ever be a 3 digit partx type, or would it always be scaled to multiples of 50m .. what about these non scene releases?
	Skalman^	well there is a lot of result when searching for part001 so i guess 
	YopoM	I am running this bat file on my whole TV now, this should be interesting
	Skalman^	http://fire.no-ip.info/FireScene/details.php?release=Pirates.Of.The.Caribbean.Dead.Mans.Chest.2006.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-hV
	YopoM	no multi cd in tv, so that's easy
	Skalman^	thats a 001
10:23	YopoM	ah
	YopoM	ok, I can add in one more level, s/b easy
	YopoM	if 001, do it, else if part01 do it, else if part001 do it, else rar and do it
10:24	Skalman^	you make it in .net?
	YopoM	inded srs with -c pver a lot of folders, is a lot more time consuming that w/o -c
	YopoM	heh
	Skalman^	oh yea movies with .001 extensions lol
10:25	YopoM	yup, they do exist
	Skalman^	yea I know, I think i have a couple myself
	Skalman^	Old releases only?
	YopoM	nope
	YopoM	there was one very recent
	YopoM	one of the 'A' groups does it exclusively
10:26	HellRezor	-c has an extra benefit of making recreating the sample faster later
	YopoM	true, but this is only checking to see if any in your collection CANNOT pass the -c test
10:27	HellRezor	it checks that it can locate the track signitures in the original and stores the location for later use
	YopoM	srs is thrown away
	YopoM	but still, do do this manaully on an existing collection, ughhhhhh
	HellRezor	regarding the error you've got earlier, it is possible that the creation would succeed with -c but the sample wouldn't be recreated ok because it only checks the track signitures and not the tracks
10:28	HellRezor	so if the actuall track is damaged either in the sample or the file you're recreating from you'll get a checksum mismatch
10:34	YopoM	Skalman^ .. it's AFO that uses .001
	YopoM	and kinobox
10:35	YopoM	hah, I've only made it into CSI, lol
10:36	HellRezor	heh, see you in a couple of days
	Skalman^	yea and ALLiANCE has some releases with that 001 too
	HellRezor	game releases used the .001
10:37	YopoM	yeah, I know games a lot
	YopoM	FLT
	HellRezor	for rars, what application creates those ?
	Skalman^	what software is that btw?
	YopoM	and many many more, but movies, more rare
	Skalman^	
	YopoM	winrar
	HellRezor	with 001 ? how
	HellRezor	also part1.rar (notice the single digit)
	YopoM	back when I ran a warez site, I experimented a lot with winrar to hide names
10:38	YopoM	in winar, if you change rar to 001, it just makes 'em numerically in order
	YopoM	for the base name
10:39	HellRezor	this i need to try
	YopoM	let me look 2 list of obfus names I used to use
10:40	HellRezor	didn't work :/
	YopoM	HubbleStarMaps.001
	YopoM	ue old style rar names, of course
	YopoM	else it wants to make partxx types
	HellRezor	i'll give it another shot
10:41	Skalman^	can you make anything? like .skalman001 and it will make it in order too?
	YopoM	ObscureLawReview2a.001
	YopoM	lol
	HellRezor	nice 
	HellRezor	worked
	Skalman^	or just only 001?
	HellRezor	always wondered how that worked
	YopoM	that was probably Call.Of.Duty (orig rars packed into smaller rars to fit host)
10:42	HellRezor	well if you try anything else, the first would be it and the next would be 001 002 etc Skalman^
	HellRezor	000
	YopoM	now if I had a series named ....
	YopoM	IntlFisheriesTerrStud 0001.Study-1070.Study
10:43	YopoM	as the first file .. and
	YopoM	IntlFisheriesTerrStud 0002.Study-1070.Study
	YopoM	as the 2nd
	YopoM	and so on
	YopoM	winrar could read 'em fine
	YopoM	how about that 
	HellRezor	how would you do that ?
10:44	YopoM	that takes a renamer batch file (make 0001 files and rename)
	YopoM	do you know, all those files, are still there after 12 years on that host
	YopoM	most amazing
	HellRezor	you mean make 001 files, then move the extention to the middle of the file name ?
	HellRezor	or you start out with 0001
10:45	YopoM	10's of thousands of 5mb files, still there
	YopoM	start out with 0001
	YopoM	or zaz0001
10:46	YopoM	or vbnnnn9001
	HellRezor	and then you append the rest ?
	HellRezor	how would you create those single digit .part?.rar ?
	YopoM	you mean for those names like ... IntlFisheriesTerrStud 0002.Study-1070.Study ?
10:47	HellRezor	yeah
	YopoM	ah
10:48	HellRezor	lol star.trek.voyager.s02e05001 star.trek.voyager.s03e05001 star.trek.voyager.s04e05001
	YopoM	for %%T in (0001 0002 0003 0004) do ren basename.%%T IntlFisheriesTerrStud.%%T.Study-1070.Study
	YopoM	for all the # tho
	YopoM	I wrote a renamer
	YopoM	as you can see, it's a pretty trivial thing
	HellRezor	yeah you just need to start with it being the extension and later winrar handles it
10:49	HellRezor	i liked how it latched on to the series number because it was right next to the dot
	HellRezor	still i wonder how would you create those single digit .part?.rar ?
	YopoM	part.1.rar types are auto made by winrar (or for any of ther above discussion, also rar itself) when file count is < 10
10:50	YopoM	when < 100 it's partxx
	YopoM	when less than 1000 .......
10:51	YopoM	ah, those fishery names, is Call.Of.Duty.2
	YopoM	hehehe
	HellRezor	ah eggzelent

10:07 < YopoM> (unless Memcoder SHERPA vs is used, all else fail)
10:07 < HellRezor> well its a specific error to those memcoder versions, there is a good chance umlaut would be able to fix the whole issue

<shEiD> Unable to locate track signature for track 2.  Aborting.
[06-Dec-2010/03:29:28] <shEiD> but just now I went to the site and saw that gui version is out :)
[06-Dec-2010/03:29:31] <@umlaut> oh yeah.  you probably want that new secret build that i've been keeping to myself
[06-Dec-2010/03:29:37] <@umlaut> just a sec
[06-Dec-2010/03:29:47] <shEiD> tried that same release with gui version and it created an srs without a hitch :)
[06-Dec-2010/03:30:12] <@umlaut> oh, i don't think the gui does the -c option?
[06-Dec-2010/03:30:30] <@umlaut> it's probably to do with mkv header compression/stripping
[06-Dec-2010/03:30:40] <shEiD> lemme check, i dont even remember now whats taht -c option
[06-Dec-2010/03:31:01] <@umlaut> it checks to make sure the tracks can be matched before creating the srs
[06-Dec-2010/03:31:20] <shEiD> yes, it has a checkbox option for -c
[06-Dec-2010/03:31:38] <@umlaut> probably won't work if you check the box ;)
[06-Dec-2010/03:31:48] <shEiD> I did check it :)
[06-Dec-2010/03:31:50] <@umlaut> if a full mkv doesn't have header stripping but the sample does, they won't match without some compensation.  i made a new version that handles it
[06-Dec-2010/03:33:54] <shEiD> ok, 1 sec, I'll throw both out puts to pastebin
[06-Dec-2010/03:33:55] <@umlaut> http://rescene.com/resample/srs.1.3.preview.zip  <-- try that one
[06-Dec-2010/03:34:22] <shEiD> oh, new version... :)

14:03 <lrkj> Expected    :       6,819,840  5AE10D3B
14:03 <lrkj> Actual      :       6,819,840  9EB2CA1C
14:03 <lrkj> Rebuild failed for sample: arw-kfp.dvdrip.xvid.sample.avi
14:06 <Skalman> its possible the sample stored is wrong
14:10 <lrkj> I downloaded the sample and created the srs myself:
14:10 <lrkj> Checking that sample exists in the specified full file...
             Check Complete.  All tracks located.
14:11 <lrkj> ah, I'm chatting with you... thought I was in the chan :)
14:13 <lrkj> srs with check says it's ok, now waiting to see if it can actually rebuild...
14:13 <lrkj> nope, same result
14:13 <lrkj> that's a bug in srs


23:19 < xaios> Ok another question, the tool doesn't seem to like quoted paths (using double quotes ") is this by design? Techincally I shouldn't have spaces
               in my paths to begin with and I guess that'd be my work around
23:22 < lrkj> can you show us how it goes wrong with an example?
23:26 < Skalman^> oh nice!! According To Jim season 5 out already, that was quick :)
23:26 < Skalman^> good show for those who dont know
23:28 < YopoM> lol
23:28 < Skalman^> :D
23:28 < YopoM> why in hell would we EVEr be having an srr with a filename with spaces
23:29 < YopoM> immed should flag .. "oooops, something very wrong"
23:29 < Skalman^> I think he mean the path
23:29 < YopoM> same thing
23:30 < YopoM> i.e., no name should have a space, red flag right there
23:31 < Skalman^> If you have in "My Documents/Downloads"
23:31 < Skalman^> There is a space
23:33 < YopoM> ah, I thought he was refering to storing the name, but maybe it's an issue with the -i and -o .. then what he said makes sense
23:33 < YopoM> (and what you said)
23:34 < YopoM> I was driving at .. "no name stored in the srr should ever have a space"
23:34 < xaios> yeah sorry I ment the folder where it resides
23:34 < xaios> srs.exe "C:\Folder With Spaces\sample.srs" "C:\Folder With Spaces\release.rar" -o "C:\Folder With Spaces\" yields an error
23:35 < xaios> System.ArgumentException: Illegal characters in path.
23:35 < YopoM> gotcha
23:35 < xaios> However that error is coming from System.IO.Path so its almost like something windows doesn't like

23:48 < xaios> I'm looking at the source now, might I suggest using the open source NDesk.Options library? it saves some headaches when dealing with those
               switches on the command line.

Skalman^	Groups often keep a "proof" sample of a nuked release, thats what happend here, and the real one was left out
	Pascal	yh
	Pascal	Skalman^: go to bed now!
	YopoM	ah, yes, that is called a comp sample, for comparitive

<cwiz> [17:54:09] Hi
<cwiz> [17:55:09] Question... When using srr with the -r flag, it will auto-locate files (using size or hash).  This works fine for reconstructing rars, but does this not work when simply verifying (with the -q flag)?
<cwiz> [17:57:13] It would also be cool if there was an option to automatically rename any files that were auto-located.
<@cxx> [17:57:52] these are gonna be rarred anyway, aren't they?
<cwiz> [17:59:00] Well, not always... I just like verifying the files, not re-rarring them.
<@cxx> [17:59:14] :S
<cwiz> [17:59:34] Some media players don't play rared files, so it's not always an option unfortunately.
<@cxx> [18:00:05] you can change media players
<cwiz> [18:00:38] I have a dedicated media player.
<@cxx> [18:01:00] oh, like a multimedia hardware thingy?
<cwiz> [18:01:05] My computer I just use VLC, but I have other media boxes (wdtv, etc.).
<cwiz> [18:01:07] Yea, exactly.
<cwiz> [18:01:32] They use their own propitiatory crap, which is very annoying.
<cwiz> [18:02:02] So I've been just verifying the files (to guarantee their integrity), but keeping them in their extracted (playable) form.
<@cxx> [18:02:09] yeah i see
<cwiz> [18:04:14] So any idea if it's possible to rename the files using srr with the -r and -q flag?
<cwiz> [18:04:46] I was just writing my own script to do it, but I figured I should just make sure before duplicating work.
<@Gfy> [18:14:35] it does currently not exist: https://bitbucket.org/Gfy/pyrescene/src/e02b9325f54de7520fcc684644f704dd436b98b9/rescene/srr.py?at=default#cl-147
<cwiz> [18:30:10] Ok, thanks!
