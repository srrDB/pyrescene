The above behavior is correct. No track location is attempted in the first case [1],
so the rebuild starts immediately. There are no separate checks in place to verify that
the provided match offset actually matches with the data found at that location.
A quick failure check could be added to all the extract sample functions [2],
but then they need to take into account the possibility to keep the broken sample.
